# Westminster College Senior Research Project: Object Avoidance Quadcopter

**Author:** Aidan Melen

**Description:**

In this project, a remote controlled quadcopter capable of detecting and reacting to nearby objects is explored. The purpose of this project is to reduce the responsibilities a pilot will have in regards to crash avoidance. The quadcopter is expected to contain the following attributes: stability will be determined by the flight controller, an array of onboard ultrasonic sonar sensors will provide object detection, and an Arduino Mega ADK microcontroller will execute the avoidance protocol. As a result, the quad will remain fixed in a relative point in space until an object triggers the aircraft to perform an avoidance maneuver, thereby directing the craft to safety.
